<h2>Installing RSTS V6</h2>
<p>
<img src='RSTSv06c.jpg' align=right>
Most of my experiences with RSTS were programming in BASIC on versions 5 and 6 using a PDP 11/45. So I thought that it would be nice if I could install either of RSTS/E V5 or V6 on my PDP 11/70 emulator. I assumed that this would be a simple enough task.
<p>
I started by reading the release notes and discovered that V6 was the first RSTS version to support the PDP 11/70, and also to be able to boot from a non-zero drive unit - ie DK2 instead of DK0. I didn't really need full PDP 11/70 support but I have found that many PDP operating systems prefer or require a zero disk unit number. As a result zero drive numbers have become a premium on my emulated system - so V6 seemed preferable to V5.
<p>
I looked around and managed to find a V6C installation tape for download at RSTS.ORG. Interestingly I could find no other V5 or V6 distributions anywhere. I did find some old postings from other people who were also looking for these.
<p>
I grabbed the V6C tape from RSTS.ORG and began an install it to an RK05 disk image using SIMH. It let me initialize the disk but when I went to copy files to disk it failed with a disk index error as below:-
<p>
<pre>
Option: <b>COpy</b>
INIT bug - bad disk index
Fatal RSTS/E system initialization error!
Option:
</pre>
<p>
I assumed that I was doing something wrong so I checked the installation manual and looked at the examples, but found nothing different to what I was doing. I  experimented with doing things in a different order, different types of output disk, and different SIMH machine configurations. None of the things I tried would work.
<p>
I contacted Brett Bump from RSTS.ORG and asked about the error. He advised that the tape copy I was using had always had this problem, as far back as 1984 when it generated the same error on a real PDP 11/45. Ouch!
<p>
I then repeated my earlier web searches for a RSTS V5 or V6 distribution or a disk image. Nothing. In deperation I posted to alt.sys.pdp11 and asked if anyone else knew where to find one. To date I still have had no response. I also noticed a photo of a DECTape V6 distribution at the Wolford Witch Project, so I fired off an email to ask about obtaining a copy of that, but sadly no response. Even if there was still an intact tape somewhere there was probably going to be a real battle to find any hardware to read it.
<p>
Reconsidering the one distribution tape I had I wondered if the tape problem could be minor - perhaps just one or two bits flipped. I thought if I looked at the code maybe I could see if there was an obvious problem, and even if not perhaps I could work around the fault and manually cause it to copy the files I needed. After all it only had to successfully install RSTS once.
<p>
Using SIMH I examined the failing installation code and could see that it was indeed checking some sort of device index at the point of the error message, but because the value was negative it was triggering the error I was seeing. I examined the code further and determined that for an RK05 the device index should be 6, which I validated after some experimentation. However even by patching in the correct index value other strange errors resulted.
<p>
I wondered if I could work around the problem by using a RSTS V7 installation to read the RSTS V6 tape, after all RSTS V7 is the closest thing I could find to the failing code. I tried a number of test set ups but this approach never looked like working.
<p>
Going back to debugging the failing V6 code I managed to find a command dispatch routine - this was important for understanding what the code was trying to do. Here I could see where a different routine was being called for each of the possible installation commands. Using this it was possible to trace and compare the operation of each individual command. Most work by calling a common subroutine with a differnt parameter block. Oddly the failing routine did not call the common subroutine. Installation command dispatch is implemented via a JMP instruction into an index table using R0 as an offset for each different command as below:-
<p>
<pre>
Option: <b>COpy</b>
Breakpoint, PC: 031176 (JMP @36370(R0))
sim>
</pre>
<p>
I wondered if I could somehow use the V7 code to understand more deeply what was going on - so I looked in the V7 installation for a similar command dispatch routine. After much searching I determined that V7 is structured completely differently and has no equivalent command dispatch or jump table. Further it appeared that the V7 copy routine is rolled into a common subroutine with other commands very unlike the V6 code. Perhaps this meant that the V6 command table was simply corrupt? However my exploration down that path yielded nothing useful.
<p>
During my code exploration I had disassembled a lot of code and it occured to me to try searching the code for a subroutine which seemed to have similar input registers and do similar initialization to the working disk initization routine. I found one which was similar enough that it even called some of the same subroutines, including one to get the date and time. This is something that other commands like disk INitialise and COpy also do. However there was nothing to reference this orphaned code, and in any case it would not run successfully when I tried to manually execute it.
<p>
A few days later I was tracing the code again and determined that the disk COpy routine really started to go wrong when it jumps to address 124000. The code there immediately expects to use register R4 which has not previously been initialized. I experimented with various options, maybe R4 was supposed to be a different register, or perhaps address 124000 was corrupted with the lower byte being zeroed. After playing around with various permutations I realized that the code I had earlier suspected of being the COpy code was located at address 123000, exactly one tape block in length away. I immediately grabbed a binary file editor and inserted a dummy tape block before the code at 123000 - relocating it to address 124000.
<p>
Below is the beginning of code for disk INitialise which works and which is similar in function to disk Copy:
<pre>
sim> <b>ex -m 104002-104100</b>
104002: MOV #12,R0
104006: MOV #113210,R2
104012: MOVB (R1)+,(R2)+
104014: BEQ 104024
104016: SOB R0,104012
104020: CLRB 113211
104024: JSR PC,@#43620
104030: CLRB 42677
</pre>
<p>
Here is the suspiciously similar orphaned code found at address 123000:
<pre>
sim> <b>ex -m 123000-123100</b>
123000: MOV #12,R0
123004: MOV #135432,R2
123010: MOVB (R1)+,(R2)+
123012: BEQ 123022
123014: SOB R0,123010
123016: CLRB 134433
123022: JSR PC,@#43620
</pre>
<p>
And finally here is the failing COpy command code at address 124000 which looks very different and uses R4 which has not been initialized.
<pre>
sim> <b>ex -m 124000-12410</b>
124000: MOV R2,52(R4)
124004: JSR PC,@#47726
124010: MOV R0,54(R4)
124014: JSR PC,126104
124020: JSR PC,125462
124024: JSR PC,@#46774
</pre>
<p>
Adding the dummy block was an immediate success! It relocated the above orphaned code from address 123000 to 124000 and allowed the COpy command to work without error.  As a minor downside the previously working disk INitialise command now complained about a missing BADB.SYS file. I used the V7 installation tape to initialize a disk containing BADB.SYS and then using the V6 COpy command to create the other files. It looked like I might actually be able to get a V6 installation working.
<p>
But alas the next step to build the key RSTS.SIL operating system load image failed. When reviewing the installation log it appeared that the Macro assembler had simply not produced any output object files during the build. No errors or messages were reported. One possibility was that the disk initialized by V7 was causing some sort of problem for the V6 system.
<p>
So it was time to go back and find out what I had broken by inserting the dummy tape block. By reviewing disassembly listings I determined that when I had added my dummy tape block I had inadvertantly relocated other code which had previously worked. By moving my inserted dummy tape block to a different position I was get both disk INitialise and disk COpy routines to work.
<p>
So back to building my RSTS V6 system files. Still no success, the Macro assembler would not produce any files required for the build of RSTS.SIL - even though my own test Macros all worked perfectly.
<p>
Figuring that perhaps the MACRO assembler had been corrupted I took all of the V6 source files to a RSTS V7 system and tried to build the files there. Unfortunately this generated exactly the same problem  - no output files and no error messages. How could that be?
<p>
I checked that my RSTS V7 system could properly build itself from its own source files. It did confirming that it's Macro assembler was fine. I began comparing the source macro files from V6 and V7. They have some parts in common but others are very different - just as you would expect from different versions of an operating system.
<p>
By experimenting with dummy input files I discovered that the problem was in a particular source file called KERNEL.MAC. When comparing the V6 file with the V7 file I noticed that V6 contained an incomplete defintion for a macro - essentially the last part of a multi-line definition was missing. When I corrected that by including content borrowewd from the V7 source the V6 modules built successfully. I was able to generate the V6 RSTS.SIL image file and go on to complete the installation of RSTS V06C-03.
<p>
It appears that when the RSTS macro assembler encounters a multi-line macro without an end it assumes all of the remaining source is part of the definition. At least until something overflows and it crashes without displaying any indication of error. My V6 Macro assembler was not corrupt - just the macro in the file KERNEL.MAC.
<p>
I decided to see if I could edit back in to the installation tape the missing section of the KERNEL.MAC macro. I doubt it is a coincidence that the section I had to insert aligned to the start of a tape block and it was exactly one tape block in length.
<p>
I think we can safely say that the installation tape has at least two completely missing blocks.
<p>
While comparing files I noticed another difference - the heading of another file called COMMON.MAC was missing it's copyright statement - I'm going to guess it is about one block in length and that it aligns on the installation tape to the start of a block. I didn't bother correcting this error as so far it hasn't caused any problems.
<p>
With two insertions of tape blocks the V6 installation tape now allows me to completely install and configure a working RSTS V06C-03 system without error. Though it works I will never completely trust it as there is no realistic way to detect what other bits may be missing. If any vital part had not been recoverable then I suspect RSTS V6 would have been lost forever.
<p>
It is nostalgic to look at this system and consider the different era which it is from. Lots of programmers like me cut their teeth on similar enviroments.
<p>
As it stands I am unaware of any other working RSTS V5 or V6 system. So please enjoy it - take the time to boot up RSTS/E V06C-03 at <a href="http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.html">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.html</a> and maybe play a game of ACEY.BAS.

<b>Welcome to RSTS V06C-03 time sharing

This system was installed from a tape with missing blocks!!
Errors which caused the installation and build to fail have been
manually patched or worked around. The result is a system which
runs but should not be relied upon too much.

I don't have any optional software tapes so this is a pretty basic
system (pun intended)

Rather interesting to look back at how things were done in the
good old days.
