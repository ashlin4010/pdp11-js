# PDP 11 Disk Images

For various reasons the emulator disk images are not included in Github. However they are online and can be accessed at:  [https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/](https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/)  

They can be downloaded or run live in the emulator at that site.

The files of type .dsk are the disk images, .tap are magnetic tape images, and .ptap are paper tape images:

```
.DSK  disk images
.TAP  magnetic tape images
.PTAP paper tape images
```
The emulator main web page lists what is contained in each of the main disk image files.

The web site also includes a resources folder
[https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/resources/](https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/resources/)  which contains various reference materials used to construct the emulator, as well as an archive folder
[https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/resources/archives/](https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/resources/archives/) of materials which I can no longer find online (it appears that some PDP-11 material is becomming more scarce).
